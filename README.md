# discord.rtpy
This repository is a fork of discord.py, which is a discord.py that continues to be developed for the bot that tasuren is developing.  
However, there is no guarantee that it will continue to be developed, so it is not safe to use it.  
This discord.rtpy will not be updated often.  
So, you are on your own if something goes wrong using this repository.

## Now
Development has not started yet.  
This is because the development of the bot, which was the reason for creating discord.rtpy, is a priority.  
Development will start a little later when this bot is developed to some extent.  
The first thing I would like to do is to make it possible to use slash commands.
